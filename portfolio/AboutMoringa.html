            Never have i been a better place like lakehub before.
            There is much to say about this place about the learning and also the environment 
            and the people incharge.
            The learning experience has been super great and fantastic and the wow part is that 
            it has been practical.Personally i have learned lot of new things and i don't regret attending the program.
            Has helped me improve my skills in javascript and bootstrap as well.
            The environment is cool and conducive for learning,i just love it.
            However,the bootcamp has also created a friend making environment and also encouraged team work.
